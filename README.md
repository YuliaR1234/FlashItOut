Learning a language is always a challenging task requiring to memorize large amounts of new words, phrases and grammatical structures. And there is no other way to do that but through multiple repetitions. It holds true for both new learners just picking up basic vocabulary and advanced practitioners aiming to advance to the next level. 
The Flash It Out app is intended to help learners practice words and phrases with flashcards showing a description and then revealing the word/phrase. The user can then mark a word/phrase as known or unknown so that the app can prioritise unknown words and show them more often, as well as the least practiced words.
